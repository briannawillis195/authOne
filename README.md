<b>Tech Used:</b>JavaScript, Node.js. Express.js, EJS, MongoDB, Passport.js

<b>Lessons Learned:</b>I learned a lot about how to utilize the MongoDB when debugging my code. A lot of times I would try to pass in values and an item would post to the list but there would be no content along with it. I used to database to see how it was logging what was being entered. I think this was a moment for me to reflect and see what other options can be available when it comes to debugging your code.
